// A class for an expandable stack. There is already a stack class in the

// A stack object wraps a low-level array indexed from 0 to capacity-1 where
// the bottommost element (if it exists) will be in slot 0. The member top is
// the index of the slot above the top element, i.e. the next available slot
// that an element can go into. Therefore if top==0 the stack is empty and
// if top==capacity it needs to be expanded before pushing another element.
// However for security there is still a super maximum capacity that cannot
// be exceeded.

  // ensure the stack capacity never goes above MAX_CAPACITY or below
  // INITIAL_CAPACITY. Because smart pointers are involved, you will need
  // to use std::move() to transfer ownership of the new array to the stack
  // after (of course) copying the elements from the old array to the new
  // array with std::copy().
